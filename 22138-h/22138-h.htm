<h3>ENGLISH AND NORMAN SONGS OF THE FOURTEENTH
CENTURY.</h3>

  <p>In a vellum book, known as <i>The Red Book of Ossory</i>, and
  preserved in the archives of that see, is contained a collection of Latin
  religious poetry, written in a good bold hand of the 14th century;
  prefixed to several of the hymns, in a contemporary and identical hand,
  are sometimes one sometimes more lines of a song in old English or Norman
  French, which as they occur I here give:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Alas hou shold y syng, yloren is my playnge</p>
      <p>Hou sholdy wiz zat olde man}</p>
      <p class="i16">} swettist of al zinge."</p>
      <p>To leven and let my leman  }</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<hr class="short" >

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Harrow ieo su thy: p fol amo<sup>r</sup> de mal amy."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<hr class="short" >

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Have m<sup>r</sup>cie on me frere: Barfote zat ygo."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<hr class="short" >

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Do Do. nightyngale syng ful myrie</p>
      <p>Shal y nevre for zyn love lengre karie."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<hr class="short" >

  <div class="poem">

  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>
<hr class="short" >

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Do Do nyztyngale syng wel miry</p>
      <p>Shal y nevre for zyn love lengre kary."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<hr class="short" >

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hew alas p amo<sup>r</sup></p>
      <p>Oy moy myst en tant dolour."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<hr class="short" >

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hey how ze chevaldoures woke al nyght."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is quite evident that these lines were thus prefixed (as is still
  the custom), to indicate the <i>air</i> to which the Latin hymns were to
  be sung. This is also set forth in a memorandum at the commencement,
  which states that these songs, <i>Cantilene</i>, were composed by the
  Bishop of Ossory for the vicars of his cathedral church, and for his
  priests and clerks,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"ne guttura eorum et ora deo sanctificata polluantur cantilenis
  teatralibus turpibus et secularibus: et cum sint cantatores, provideant
  sibi notis convenientibus, secundum quod dictamina
  requirunt."&mdash;<i>Lib. Rub. Ossor.</i> fol. 70.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We may, I think, safely conclude that the lines above given were the
  commencement of the <i>cantilene teatrales turpes</i> et
  <i>seculares</i>, which the good bishop wished to deprive his clergy of
  all excuse for singing, by providing them with pious hymns to the same
  airs; thinking, I suppose, like John Wesley in after years, it was a pity
  the devil should monopolise all the good tunes. I shall merely add that
  the author of the Latin poetry seems to have been Richard de Ledrede, who
  filled <!-- Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page386"></a>{386}</span>the see of Ossory from 1318 to 1360, and
  was rendered famous by his proceedings against Dame Alice Kyteller for
  heresy and witchcraft. (See a contemporary account of the "proceedings"
  published by the Camden Society in 1843; a most valuable contribution to
  Irish history, and well deserving of still more editorial labour than has
  been bestowed on it.) I have copied the old English and Norman-French
  word for word, preserving the contractions wherever they occurred.</p>

  <p>I shall conclude this "note" by proposing two "Queries:" to such of
  your contributors as are learned in old English and French song-lore,
  viz.,</p>

  <p>1. Are the entire songs, of which the above lines form the
  commencements, known or recoverable?</p>

  <p>2. If so, is the music to which they were sung handed down?</p>

  <p>I shall feel much obliged by answers to both or either of the above
  Queries, and</p>

<h3>MISPLACED WORDS IN SHAKSPEARE'S TROILUS AND
CRESSIDA.</h3>

  <p>In that immaculate volume, the first folio edition of Shakspeare, of
  which Mr. Knight says: "Perhaps, all things considered, there never was a
  book so correctly printed"! a passage in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>,
  Act. v. Sc. 3., where Cassandra and Andromache are attempting to dissuade
  Hector from going to battle, is thus given:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>And.</i> O be perswaded: doe not count it holy,</p>
      <p>To hurt by being iust; it is lawful:</p>
      <p>For we would count giue much to as violent thefts,</p>
      <p>And rob in the behalfe of charitie."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Deviating from his usual practice, Mr. Knight makes an omission and a
  transposition, and reads thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i10hg3">"Do not count it holy</p>
      <p>To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,</p>
      <p>For we would give much, to count violent thefts,</p>
      <p>And rob in the behalf of charity."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>with the following note; the ordinary reading is</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'For we would give much <i>to use</i> violent thefts.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>To use thefts</i> is clearly not Shakspearian. Perhaps <i>count</i>
  or <i>give</i> might be omitted, supposing that one word had been
  substituted for another in the manuscript, without the erasure of the
  first written; but this omission will not give us a meaning. We have
  ventured to transpose <i>count</i> and omit <i>as</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For we would give much, to count violent thefts."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>We have now a clear meaning: it is as lawful because we desire to give
  much, to count violent thefts as <i>holy</i>, "and rob in the behalf of
  charity."</p>

  <p>Mr. Collier also lays aside his aversion to vary from the old copy,
  and makes a bold innovation: he reads,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i10hg3">"Do not count it holy</p>
      <p>To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,</p>
      <p>For us to give much count to violent thefts,</p>
      <p>And rob in the behalf of charity."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Thus giving his reasons: "This line [the third] is so corrupt in the
  folio 1623, as to afford no sense. The words and their arrangement are
  the same in the second and third folio, while the fourth only alters
  <i>would</i> to <i>will</i>." Tyrwhitt read:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For we would give much to use violent thefts,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>which is objectionable, not merely because it wanders from the text,
  but because it inserts a phrase, "to <i>use</i> violent thefts," which is
  awkward and unlike Shakspeare. The reading I have adopted is that
  suggested by Mr. Amyot, who observes upon it: "Here, I think, with little
  more than transposition (<i>us</i> being, substituted for <i>we</i>, and
  <i>would</i> omitted), the meaning, as far as we can collect it, is not
  departed from nor perverted, as in Rowe's strange interpolation:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For us to count we give what's gain'd by thefts."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The original is one of the few passages which, as it seems to me, must
  be left to the reader's sagacity, and of the difficulties attending which
  we cannot arrive at any satisfactory solution."</p>

  <p>Mr. Collier's better judgment has here given way to his deference for
  the opinion of his worthy friend; the deviation from the old copy being
  quite as violent as any that he has ever quarrelled with in others.</p>

  <p>Bearing in mind <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson's</span> valuable canon
  (which should be the guide of future editors), let us see what is the
  state of the case. The line is a nonsensical jumble, and has probably
  been printed from an interlineation in the manuscript copy, two words
  being evidently transposed, and one of them, at the same time, glaringly
  mistaken. The poet would never have repeated the word <i>count</i>, which
  occurs in the first line, in the sense given to it either by Mr. Collier
  or by Mr. Knight.</p>

  <p>Preserving every word in the old copy, I read the passage
  thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O! be persuaded. Do not count it holy</p>
      <p>To hurt by being just: it is as lawful as</p>
      <p>(For we would give much) to commit violent thefts</p>
      <p>And rob in the behalf of charity."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"To <i>count</i> violent thefts" here would be sheer nonsense; and
  when we recollect how easy it is to mistake <i>comit</i> for
  <i>count</i>, the former word being almost always thus written and often
  thus printed, we must, I think, be convinced that in copying an
  interlineated MS., the printer <i>misplaced</i> and <i>misprinted</i>
  that word, and transposed <i>as</i>, if the repetition of it be not also
  an error.&mdash;"For," commencing the parenthesis, "we would give much"
  stands for <i>cause</i>. The emphasis should, I think, be <!-- Page 387

<h3>MASTER JOHN SHORNE.</h3>

  <p>If proof were wanted how little is now known of those saints whose
  names were once in everybody's mouth, although they never figured in any
  calendar, it might be found in the fact that my friend, Mr. Payne
  Collier, whose intimate knowledge of the phrases and allusions scattered
  through our early writers is so well known and admitted, should, in his
  valuable <i>Extracts from the Registers of the Stationers' Company</i>
  (1557-1570), have illustrated this entry,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1569-70. Rd. of Thomas Colwell, for his lycense for the pryntinge of
  a ballett intituled 'Newes to Northumberlande yt skylles not where, to
  Syr John Shorne, a churche rebell there' ... iiij<sup>d</sup>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>by a note, from which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir John Shorne no doubt is to be taken as a generic name for a
  shaven Roman Catholic priest."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Reasonable, however, as is Mr. Collier's conjecture, it is not borne
  out by the facts of the case. The name Sir John Shorne is not a generic
  name, but the name of a personage frequently alluded to, but whose
  history is involved in considerable obscurity. Perhaps the following
  notes may be the means, by drawing forth others, of throwing some light
  upon it. In Michael Wodde's <i>Dialogue</i>, quoted by Brand, we
  read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If we were sycke of the pestylence we ran to Sainte Rooke; if of the
  ague, to Sainte Pernel or Master John Shorne."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Latimer, in his <i>Second Sermon preached in Lincolnshire</i>, p. 475.
  (Parker Society ed.), says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But ye shall not think that I will speak of the popish pilgrimages,
  which we were wont to use in times past, in running hither and thither to
  Mr. John Shorn or to our Lady of Walsingham."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On which the editor, the Rev. G. E. Corrie, remarks that he
  was&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A saint whose head quarters were probably in the parish of Shorn and
  Merston near Gravesend, but who seems to have had shrines in other parts
  of the country. He was chiefly popular with persons who suffered from
  ague."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Corrie then gives an extract from p. 218. of the <i>Letters
  relating to the Suppression of Monasteries</i>, edited by Mr. Wright for
  the Camden Society; but we quote from the original, Mr. Corrie having
  omitted the words given in our extract in Italics:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At Merston, Mr. Johan Schorn stondith blessing a bote, whereunto they
  do say he conveyd the devill. He ys moch sowzt for the agou. <i>If it be
  your lordeschips pleasur, I schall sett that botyd ymage in a nother
  place, and so do wyth other in other parties wher lyke seeking
  ys.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In that extraordinary poem <i>The Fantassie of Idolatrie</i>, printed
  by Fox in his edition of 1563, but not afterwards reprinted until it
  appeared in Seeley's edition (vol. v. p. 406.), we read&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To Maister John Shorne</p>
      <p>That blessed man borne;</p>
      <p class="i1">For the ague to him we apply,</p>
      <p>Whiche jugeleth with a <i>bote</i></p>
      <p>I beschrewe his herte rote</p>
      <p class="i1">That will truste him, and it be I."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The editor, Mr. Cattley, having explained <i>bote</i> "a recompense or
  fee," Dr. Maitland, in his <i>Remarks on Rev. S. R. Cattley's Defence of
  his Edition of Fox's Martyrology</i>, p. 46., after making a reference to
  Nares, and quoting his explanation, proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The going on pilgrimage to St. John Shorne is incidentally mentioned
  at pages 232. and 580. of the <span class="scac">FOURTH</span> volume of
  Fox, but in a way which throws no light on the subject. The verse which I
  have quoted seems as if there was some relic which was supposed to cure
  the ague, and by which the juggle was carried on. Now another passage in
  this same fifth volume, p. 468., leads me to believe that this relic
  really was, and therefore the word 'bote' simply means, a boot. In this
  passage we learn, that one of the causes of Robert Testwood's troyble was
  his ridiculing the relics which were to be distributed to be borne by
  various persons in a procession upon a relic Sunday. St. George's dagger
  having been given to one Master Hake, Testwood said to Dr.
  Clifton,&mdash;'Sir, Master Hake hath St. George's dagger. Now if he had
  his horse, and St. Martin's cloak, and <i>Master John Shorne's boots</i>,
  with King Harry's spurs and his hat, he might ride when he list.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That there is some legend connected with Master John Shorne and "his
  bote, whereunto they do say he conveyd the devill," is evident from <!--
  Page 388 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page388"></a>{388}</span>a
  fact we learn from the <i>Proceedings of the ArchÃ¦ological Institute</i>,
  namely, that at the meeting on the 5th Nov. 1847, the Rev. James Bulwer,
  of Aylsham, Norfolk, sent a series of drawings exhibiting the curious
  painted decorations of the rood screen in Cawston Church, Norfolk,
  amongst which appears the singular saintly personage bearing a boot, from
  which issues a demon. An inscription beneath the figures gives the name
  "Magister Johannes Schorn." It is much to be regretted that fuller
  details of this painting have not been preserved in the Journal of the
  Institute.</p>

  <p>The earliest mention of <i>Master John Schorne</i> is in the indenture
  for roofing St. George's Chapel at Windsor, dated 5th June, 21 Henry VII.
  (1506), printed in the <i>ReliquiÃ¦ AntiquÃ¦</i>, vol. ii. p. 115., where
  it is covenanted</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That the creastes, corses, beastes, above on the outsides of Maister
  John Shorne's Chappell, bee done and wrought according to the other
  creastes, and comprised within the said bargayne."</p>

<h3>CORRIGENDA OF PRINTER'S ERRORS.</h3>

  <p>In my note on Conjectural Emendation (Vol. ii., p. 322.), your
  printer, in general so very correct, has by a fortunate accident
  strengthened my argument, by adding one letter, and taking away another.
  Should my note be in existence, you will find that I wrote distinctly and
  correctly Mr. Field's prÃ¦nomen <i>Barron</i>, and not <i>Baron</i>. And I
  have too much respect for my old favourite, honest George <i>Wither</i>,
  to have written <i>Withers</i>, a misnomer never used but by his
  adversaries, who certainly did speak of him as "one Withers." I should
  not have thought it necessary to notice these insignificant errata, but
  for the purpose of showing <i>Printer's errors</i> do and will occur, and
  that Shakspeare's text may often be amended by their correction. You will
  recollect honest George's punning inscription round his juvenile
  portrait:</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE OF WALES.</h3>

  <p><i>No. 3. Meddygon Myddvai</i>.&mdash;On the heights of the Black
  Mountains, in Caermarthenshire, lies a dark-watered lake, known by the
  name of <i>Lyn y Van Vach</i>. As might be predicated, from the wild
  grandeur of its situation, as well as from the ever-changing hues which
  it takes from the mountain shadows, many a superstition&mdash;gloomy or
  beautiful&mdash;is connected with its history. Amongst these may be
  reckoned the legend of the <i>Meddygon Myddvai</i> or "surgeons of
  Myddvai." Tradition affirms that "once upon a time" a man who dwelt in
  the parish of Myddvai led his lambs to graze on the borders of this lake;
  a proceeding which he was induced to repeat in consequence of his visits
  being celebrated by the appearance of three most beautiful nymphs, who,
  rising from the waters of the lake, frequently came on shore, and
  wandered about amongst his flock. On his endeavouring, however, to catch
  or retain these nymphs, they fled to the lake and sank into its depths,
  singing&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Cras dy fara,</p>
      <p>Anhawdd ein dala!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>which may be rendered [eater of] "hard baked bread, it is difficult to
  retain us!" Difficulties, however, but increased the determination of the
  shepherd; and day after day he watched beside the haunted lake, until at
  length his perseverance was rewarded by the discovery of a substance
  resembling unbaked bread, which floated on the water: this he fished up
  and ate, and on the following day he succeeded in capturing the nymphs:
  on which he requested one of them to become his wife; to this she
  consented, on condition that he should be able to distinguish her from
  her sisters on the following day. This was no easy task, as the nymphs
  bore the most striking resemblance to each other; but the lover noticed
  some trifling peculiarity in the dress of his choice, by means of which
  he identified her. She then assured him that she would be to him as good
  a wife as any <i>earthly</i> maiden could be, until he should strike her
  three times without a cause. This was deemed by the shepherd an
  impossible contingency, and he led his bride in triumph from the
  mountain; followed by seven cows, two oxen, and one bull, which she had
  summoned from the waters of the lake to enrich her future home.</p>

  <p>Many years passed happily on, and three smiling
  children&mdash;afterwards the "surgeons of Myddvai"&mdash;blessed the
  shepherd and his Undine-like bride; but at length, on requesting her to
  go to the field and catch his horse, she replied that she would do so
  presently; when striking her arm three times he exclaimed, <i>DÃ´s, dÃ´s,
  dÃ´s</i>; Go, go, go. This was more than a free dweller in the waters
  could brook; so calling her ten head of cattle to follow her, she fled to
  the lake, and once more plunged beneath its waters.</p>

  <p>Such is the legend; of which reason vainly expresses its disbelief, as
  long as the eye of faith can discern physical proofs of its truth in the
  deep furrow which, crossing the mountain in detached portions, terminates
  abruptly in the lake; for it seems that when the two oxen were summoned
  by their mistress, they were ploughing in the field; and at their
  departure, they carried the plough with them, and dragged it into the
  lake.</p>

  <p>The nymph once more appeared upon the earth; for as her sons grew to
  manhood, she met them <!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page389"></a>{389}</span>one day in a place which, from this
  circumstance, received the name of <i>Cwm Meddygon</i>, and delivered to
  each of them a bag, containing such mysterious revelations in the science
  of medicine, that they became greater in the art than were ever any
  before them.</p>

  <p>Though so curiously connected with this fable, the "surgeons of
  Myddvai" are supposed to be historical personages, who, according to a
  writer in the <i>Cambro-Briton</i>, flourished in the thirteenth century,
  and left behind them a MS. treatise on their practice, of which several
  fragments and imperfect copies are still preserved.</p>

  <p><i>No. 4. Trwyn Pwcca.</i>&mdash;Many years ago, there existed in a
  certain part of Monmouthshire a Pwcca, or fairy, which, like a faithful
  English Brownie, performed innumerable services for the farmers and
  householders in its neighbourhood, more especially that of feeding the
  cattle, and cleaning their sheds in wet weather; until at length some
  officious person, considering such practices as unchristian proceedings,
  laid the kindly spirit for three generations, banishing him to that
  common receptacle for such beings&mdash;the Red Sea. The spot in which he
  disappeared obtained the name of <i>Trwyn Pwcca</i> (Fairy's nose); and
  as the three generations have nearly passed away, the approaching return
  of the Pwcca is anxiously looked forward to in its vicinity, as an
  earnest of the "good time coming."</p>

  <p>The form which tradition assigns to this Pwcca, is that of a handful
  of loose dried grass rolling before the wind (such as is constantly seen
  on moors); a circumstance which recalls to mind the Pyrenean legend of
  the spirit of the Lord of Orthez, mentioned by Miss Costello, which
  appeared as two straws moving on the floor. Query, Has the name of "Will
  o' the Wisp" any connexion with the supposed habit of appearing in this
  form?</p>

<h3>CONNEXION OF WORDS&mdash;THE WORD "FREIGHT."</h3>

  <p>The word employed to denote <i>freight</i>, or rather the <i>price of
  freight</i>, at this day in the principal ports of the Mediterranean, is
  <i>nolis</i>, <i>nolo</i>, &amp;c. In the Arabian and Indian ports, the
  word universally employed to denote the same meaning is <i>nol</i>. Are
  these words identical, and can their connexion be traced? When we
  consider the extensive commerce of the Ph&oelig;nicians, both in the
  Mediterranean and Indian seas, that they were the great merchants and
  carriers of antiquity, and that, in the words of Hieron, "their numerous
  fleets were scattered over the Indian and Atlantic oceans; and the Tyrian
  pennant waved at the same time on the coasts of Britain and on the shores
  of Ceylon"&mdash;it is natural to look to that country as the birthplace
  of the word, whence it may have been imported, westward to Europe, and
  eastward to India, by the same people. And we find that it is a pure
  Arabic word, <span lang="ar" title="nwl" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x646;&#x648;&#x644;</bdo></span> <i>nawil</i> and <span
  lang="ar" title="nwln" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x646;&#x648;&#x644;&#x646;</bdo></span> <i>nawlun</i>, or
  <i>nol</i> and <i>nolan</i>, both signifying <i>freight</i> (price of
  carriage), from the root <span lang="ar" title="nwh" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x646;&#x648;&#x647;</bdo></span> <i>noh, pretium dedit,
  donum</i>. I am not aware that the word <i>freight</i> (not used in the
  sense of cargo or merchandise, but as the <i>price</i> of carriage of the
  merchandise, <i>merces pro vectura</i>) is to be found in the Old
  Testament, otherwise some light might be thrown on the matter by a
  reference to the cognate Hebrew word.</p>

  <p>But here an interesting question presents itself. The word
  <i>freight</i> in Greek is <span title="naulos" class="grk"
  >&nu;&alpha;&#x1FE6;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> or <span
  title="naulon" class="grk"
  >&nu;&alpha;&#x1FE6;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span>, and in Latin
  <i>naulum</i>. Have these any connexion with the Arabic word, or are they
  to be traced to an independent source, and the coincidence in sense and
  sound with the Arabic merely accidental? If distinct, are the words now
  in use in the Mediterranean ports derived from the Greek or the Arabic?
  If the words be not identical, may not the Greek be derived from the
  Sanscrit, thus <img src="images/nau.png" style="height:2.5ex;
  width:1.2em" alt="nau" /> <i>nau</i>, or in the pure form <img
  src="images/nawah.png" style="height:2.5ex; width:1.4em" alt="nawah" />
  <i>nawah</i>, or resolved, <i>naus</i>, a ship or boat; <img
  src="images/nauyayin.png" style="height:2.5ex; width:4em" alt="nauyayin"
  /> <i>nauyÃ¡yin</i> quasi <i>nouyÃ¡yil</i>, or abbreviated <i>naul</i>,
  that which goes into a ship or boat, <i>i.e.</i> freight, fare, or, by
  metonyme, the price of freight, or passage-money. It is to be noted that
  <i>nolis</i>, though in general use in the Mediterranean ports
  (Marseilles, for example) to denote the price of freight, or of carriage,
  is not so in the northern parts of France. At Havre the word is
  <i>frÃªt</i>, the same as our <i>freight</i>, the German <i>fracht</i>,
  viz. that which is <i>carried</i> or <i>ferried</i>, and, by metonyme, as
  before, the <i>price</i> of carriage.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Smith's Obituary.</i>&mdash;One of the publications of the Camden
  Society for the year 1849 is the <i>Obituary of Richard Smyth</i>
  (extending from 1627 to 1674), edited by Sir Henry Ellis. It is printed
  from a copy of the Sloane MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 886., which is
  itself but a transcript, later than Smyth's time. The editor states that
  "where the original manuscript of the obituary is deposited is not at
  present known."</p>

  <p>I am glad at being able to supply the information here wanted. The
  original manuscript is in the <i>University Library</i> at Cambridge,
  marked Mm. 4. 36. It consists of twenty-nine leaves, foolscap folio; and,
  except that the edges and corners of the leaves are occasionally worn by
  frequent perusal, is otherwise in excellent condition. It is well and
  clearly written, but the latter part of it marks the alteration of the
  hand by the advancing years of the writer. There are many variations in
  <!-- Page 390 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page390"></a>{390}</span>the orthography, and some omissions, in
  the Camden Society's publication, but perhaps not more than may be
  accounted for by supposing the Sloane copy to have been made by a not
  very careful transcriber.</p>

  <p>Here again is seen the valuable use which might be made of your
  excellent publication. Had a "Hue and Cry" been made in the "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" after the original MS. of this
  obituary, information might have been immediately given which would have
  added greatly to the value of this number of the Camden Society's
  publications.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>EARLY SALE OF GEMS, DRAWINGS, AND CURIOSITIES.</h3>

  <p>At the risk of showing my ignorance, I wish to have it removed by
  answers to my present Queries.</p>

  <p>I have before me a printed catalogue of a collection of antiques,
  drawings, and curiosities, which were to be sold by auction not far from
  a century and a half ago. It is upon a sheet of four pages, rather larger
  than foolscap, which it entirely fills. It seems to me a remarkable
  assemblage of valuable relics, and it is thus headed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A catalogue, being an extraordinary and great collection of antiques,
  original drawings, and other curiosities, collected by a gentleman very
  curious ... will be sold by auction at Covent Garden Coffee House, in the
  Little Piazza, on Wednesday next, being the 9th instant June, 1714."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is the oldest English catalogue of the kind that I happen to have
  met with, and my first question upon it is, is there any older? Next, if
  the fact be known, who was the "gentleman very curious" who owned the
  collection?</p>

  <p>We are farther informed by the auctioneer (whose name is not given),
  that "The antiques are all in precious stones, most of them engraved by
  the greatest masters of the old Greeks and Romans; the drawings are of
  the oldest and the best Italian masters;" and it is advertised, besides,
  that "the aforesaid rarities may be seen on Monday the 7th, Tuesday the
  8th, and Wednesday till the time of sale, which will begin at 11 o'clock
  in the morning for the antiques, and at 6 o'clock in the evening for the
  drawings." After a statement that the "conditions of sale are as usual,"
  we come to the list of the gems, under the heads of "Names of the
  Jewels," and "What they represent." There are fifty-one lots of those
  that are "set in silver for seals," and they are upon cornelian, beril,
  sardonix, jasper, &amp;c. For the purpose of identification (if possible)
  I will quote two or three:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"3. Sardonix&mdash;The head of Anacreon.</p>
      <p>17. Cornelian&mdash;Pallas crowning Hercules.</p>

      <p>51. A cornelian ring, with the head of Lais of Corinth, engraved by Mr. Christian."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To these succeed twelve lots of "stones not set," including a "Head of
  Christ," a "Gadetian Droll," the "Entry of Severus, the Emperor, into
  Britain," &amp;c. Then we come to 22. "Camejus, for the most part
  modern;" and to 10. "Other extraordinary Rarities," including</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>4. "The Picture of Mathew of Leyden, King of the Anabaptists, done in miniature by Holbein.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 391 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page391"></a>{391}</span></p>

  <p>The "antiques set in gold, being rings or seals," are thirty-seven in
  number; among them</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"8. Ennius the poet, with this motto, <i>Sine lucto memento</i>, a seal.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The Drawings come last, and are divided into seven <i>Porta
  Folios</i>, containing respectively 21, 23, 30, 23, 24, 26 and 42
  specimens. In the first two no names of the masters are given: in the
  third, they are all assigned to various artists, including Emskirk (I
  spell names as I find them), Paulo Veronesa, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci,
  Tintorett, Giulio Romano, &amp;c. The fourth portfolio has only one name
  to the 23 lots, viz. Tintorett; and Filippo Bellin is the only master
  named in the fifth portfolio. In the sixth, we meet with Tintorett,
  Perugino, Mich. Ang. Bonaroti, Annibal Caracci, Paulo Brill, and Raphael.
  Of the 42 drawings in Portfolio 7. all have names annexed to them,
  excepting eight; and here we read those of Guido Reni, Gio Bellini,

  <p>I may have gone into more detail than was necessary; but, besides the
  Queries I have already put, I want to know if any of these gems, cameos,
  antiques, or drawings are now known to be in existence; and, if possible,
  where they are to be found.</p>

<h2>MINOR QUERIES.</h2>

  <p><i>Quotations wanted.</i>&mdash;I shall be greatly obliged to any of
  the correspondents of your most interesting and useful publication who
  will kindly inform me in what authors the following passages are to be
  found, and will, if it can be done without too much trouble, give me the
  references necessary for tracing them:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The latter I have only seen subjoined to a print of Guido's celebrated
  Aurora, at Rome; and I should have supposed it might have been written
  for the occasion, had I not been told, upon authority in which I put
  confidence, that it is to be found in some classic author. If so, the
  lines may possibly have given rise to the painting, and not the painting
  to the lines.</p>

  <p><i>Avidius Varus.</i>&mdash;Can you, or any of your readers, tell me
  who <i>Avidius Varus</i> was, referred to in the following passage:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sed <i>Avidii Vari</i> illud hic valeat:</p>

  <p><i>Death of Richard II.</i>&mdash;By what authority has the belief
  that Richard II. died in Pontefract Castle, in Yorkshire, arisen? Every
  history that I have consulted (with the exception, indeed, of Lord
  Lyttleton's) coolly assumes it as a fact, in the teeth of the
  contemporary Froissart, who says plainly enough&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Thus they left the <i>Tower of London where he had died</i>, and
  paraded the streets at a foot's pace till they came to
  Cheapside."&mdash;<i>Froissart's Chronicles</i>, translated by Johnes,
  vol. vii. p. 708.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is barely possible that our modern historians may have been misled
  by Shakspeare, who makes Pontefract the scene of his death.</p>

  <p>Another circumstance which militates against the received story, is
  the fact that all historians, I believe, agree that his <i>dead body</i>
  was conveyed to burial from the Tower of London. Now, it seems odd, to
  say the least, that if he really died at Pontefract, and his corpse was
  removed to London, that no one mentions this removal&mdash;that Froissart
  had not heard of it, although, from the nature of the country, the want
  of good roads, &amp;c., the funeral convoy must have been several days
  upon the road. Can any one give me any information upon this question? I
  may just say that, of course, no reliance can be placed on the fact of
  the "very identical tower" in which the deposed king died being shown at
  Pontefract.</p>

  <p><i>Sir W. Herschel's Observations and Writings.</i>&mdash;Will you
  permit me to propose the following Queries in your excellent paper.</p>

  <p>1. I have a note to the following effect, but it is without date or
  reference. The late Sir W. Herschel, during an examination of the heavens
  in which he was observing stars that have a proper motion, saw one of the
  7.8 magnitude near the 17th star 12 hour of Piazzi's Catalogue, and noted
  the approximate distance between them; on the third night after, he saw
  it again, when it had advanced a good deal, having gone farther to the
  eastward, and towards the equator. Bad weather, and the advancing
  twilight, prevented Sir William's getting another observation. Meantime
  the estimated movement in three days was 10&Prime; in right ascension,
  and about a minute, or rather less, towards the north. "So slow a
  motion," he says, <!-- Page 392 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page392"></a>{392}</span>"would make me suspect the situation to be
  beyond Uranus." What I wish to inquire is this: has it been established
  by calculation whether the new planet discovered by Adams and Le Verrier
  was or was not the star observed at the time and in the place specified
  by Sir William Herschel?</p>

  <p>2. Have Sir W. Herschel's contributions to the <i>Philosophical
  Transactions</i> ever been published in a separate form? and if so, where
  they can be obtained?</p>

  <p><i>Camden's Poem on Marriage of the Thames and Isis.</i>&mdash;I
  should esteem it a favour if any reader of the "<span class="sc">Notes
  and Queries</span>" would inform me where I can find a Latin poem of
  Camden's on the "Marriage of the Thames with the Isis." In his work
  styled <i>Britannia</i> (which was enlarged by Richard Gough, in 3 vols.,
  fol. Lond. 1789), in vol. i. p. 169., under Surrey, Camden himself quotes
  two passages; and in vol. ii., under Middlesex, p. 2., one passage, from
  the above-mentioned poem. I have in vain made many endeavours to find the
  <i>entire poem</i>. I have examined the original work, as well as all the
  translations of <i>Britannia, sive Florentissimorum Regnorum AngliÃ¦,
  etc., chorographica descriptio; Gulielmo Camdeno, authore</i>, Londini,
  1607, folio. All these contain the quotations I have specified, but no
  more, and I am anxious to see the whole of the poem.</p>

  <p><i>National Airs of England.</i>&mdash;Among the national gleanings
  which are sent to your journal, I have not seen any that relate to the
  traditional music of England. We allow our airs to be stolen on all
  sides, and, had not Mr. Chappell acted the part of a detective, might
  never have recovered our own property. Ireland has taken "My Lodging is
  on the cold Ground" and "The Girls we leave behind us," while Scotland
  has laid claim to all her own <i>at least</i>, and Germany is laying
  violent hands on "God save the Queen."</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, would it not be a good thing, for those who
  have the power, to communicate the simple air of any song which appears
  native to our country, together with the words? I fancy that in this way
  we should gain many hints, besides musical ones, highly interesting to
  your readers.</p>

  <p><i>Burton's Parliamentary Diary.</i>&mdash;The sale of <i>clergymen

  <p><i>Tobacconists.</i>&mdash;At p. 320, vol. i., of Burton's
  <i>Parliamentary Diary</i> it is stated, that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir John Reynolds said he had numbered the House, and there were at

  <p>What and who were the persons designated as tobacconists?</p>

  <p class="author">P. T.</p>

  <p><i>"The Owl is abroad."</i>&mdash;On what ground is the fine base
  song, "The Owl is abroad," attributed to Henry Purcell? Dr. Clarke has
  done so in his well-known selections from Purcell's works; and Mr. G.
  Hogarth, in his <i>Memoirs of the Musical Drama</i>, speaking of
  Purcell's <i>Tempest</i>, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is a song for Caliban, <i>The Owl is abroad, the Bat and the
  Toad</i>, which one might suppose Weber to have imagined."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Is it not really the property of John Christopher Smith, the friend of
  Handel? Amongst the few books of printed music in the <i>British Museum
  Catalogue</i> is <i>The Tempest, an Opera, composed by Mr. Smith</i>, in
  which is the base song in question. On the other hand, I do not find it
  in Purcell's <i>Tempest</i>. If, as I imagine, it belongs to Mr. Smith,
  it seems peculiarly hard that the credit of the composition should be
  taken from him, to be given to one who stands in no need of it.</p>

  Elizabeth had a son, bred in the state of Venice, and a daughter, I know
  not where or when;' with other strange tales that went on her I neglect
  to insert, as fitter for a romance than to mingle with so much truth and
  integrity as I profess."</p>

  <p>Is this rumour any where else alluded to? and if so, upon what
  foundation?</p>

  <p><i>Letters of Horning.</i>&mdash;What is the meaning of "letters of

  <p><i>Cromwell Poisoned.</i>&mdash;At p. 516. vol. ii. of Burton's

  Oliver Cromwell, that his body exhibited certain appearances "owing to
  the disease of which the Protector died, which, by the by, appeared to be

<h3>COLLAR OF SS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., pp. 89. 194. 248. 280. 330. 362.)</p>

  <p>The dispute about the Collar of SS., between <span class="sc">Mr. J.
  Gough Nichols</span> and <span class="sc">Armiger</span>, is, as Sir
  Lucius O'Trigger would say, "a mighty pretty quarrel as it stands;" but I
  have seen no mention by either writer of "the red sindon" for the chamber
  of Queen Philippa, "beaten throughout with the letter S in gold leaf:" or
  the throne of Henry V. powdered with the letter S, in an illuminated MS.
  of his time, in Bennet College Library, Cambridge. I fancy there will be
  some difficulty in reconciling these two examples with the theory of
  either of the disputants. When <span class="sc">Armiger</span> alludes to
  the monument of Matilda Fitzwalter, "who lived in the reign of King
  John," I presume he is aware that the effigy is not of that period. I do
  not think any of the seekers of this hidden signification can be said to
  be even <i>warm</i> yet, much less to burn.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. R. PlanchÃ©.</span></p>

  <p><i>Collar of SS.</i>&mdash;As I conceive that the description of this
  Collar by your correspondent C. (Vol. ii., p. 330.) is not strictly
  correct, I forward you drawings of two examples: No. 1. from the monument
  of Sir Humphrey Stafford (and which is the general type); No. 2. from
  that of the husband of Margaret Holand, Countess of Somerset (Gough's
  <i>Funeral Monuments</i>). The latter example might have been called a
  Collar of 8, 8, were it not that that name is less euphonious than SS.
  The collar was worn by several ladies. (See the work above quoted.)</p>

  <p class="author">B. W.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The figures in the example No. 1. forwarded by B. W. cannot possibly
  have been intended for <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page394"></a>{394}</span>anything but SS.; while, on the other
  hand, those in No. 2., as he rightly observes, are more like figures 8,
  8, than the letters SS.]</p>

</div>

  <p>While the origin of the Collar of Esses is instructively occupying
  your correspondents, allow me to direct your attention to the enclosed
  paragraph extracted from the <i>Morning Post</i> of the 18th instant,
  from which it appears that Lord Denman's collar has been "obtained"
  (<i>Qy.</i> by purchase?) by the corporation of Derby for the future use
  of their mayor. I wish to know, can a <i>Quo warranto</i> issue to the
  said mayor for the assumption of this badge? and if not, in whom does the
  power reside of correcting this abuse, if such it be?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">The Gold Chain of the Lord Chief Justice of
  England.</span>&mdash;On Wednesday week, at a meeting of the corporation
  of Derby, the mayor stated that the chain he then had the honour to wear
  was the one worn by the Lord Chief Justice of England, and that it had
  been obtained from Lord Denman by the corporation for all future chief
  magistrates of the borough. We understand the corporation obtained the
  chain upon the same terms as it would have been transferred to Lord
  Campbell, if his lordship had taken to it from his noble
  predecessor."&mdash;(<i>Quoted from Nottingham Journal, in Morning
  Post</i>, 18th Oct. 1850.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">F. S. Q.</p>

  <p>The inclosed paragraph, extracted from the <i>Morning Post</i> of last
  Saturday completes the history of the municipal collar of the corporation
  of Derby, concerning which I recently proposed a Query. The right to
  purchase does not, however, establish the right to wear such a
  decoration.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">The Insignia of Mayoralty.</span>&mdash;Considerable
  excitement prevails just now in many municipal corporations respecting
  the insignia of mayoralty. At Derby the mayor has recently obtained the
  gold chain worn by Lord Denman when Lord Chief Justice. In reference to a
  question whether or not the chain was a present, a correspondent of the
  <i>Derby Mercury</i> says, 'I am sorry to admit, it was a bargain; it
  cost 100<i>l.</i>, and is paid for. The chain is the property of the
  corporation, and will grace the neck of every succeeding mayor. The robes
  did not accompany the chain; they are bran new, gay in colour, a good
  cut, and hang well; they are private property, consequently not
  necessarily transferable. Every mayor will have the privilege of choosing
  the shape and colour of his official vestment, and can retain or dispose
  of it as he may deem proper. It was suggested that the robes should be
  the property of the corporation, but a difficulty arose, from the fact,
  that mayors differ as much in their bodies as they do in their minds, so
  that one measure would not conveniently fit all. Economically speaking,
  the suggestion was a valuable one, but the physical difficulty was
  insurmountable. It has been hinted that a wardrobe of habiliments for
  different sized mayors might be kept on hand at the Town-Hall, but as the
  cost would be great, and the arrangement would partake too much of the
  customary preparation for a fancy ball or masquerade, it was thought
  objectionable. The Liberal corporation have, therefore, very properly
  resolved on throwing no obstacle in the way of Free Trade, and it is
  their determination to enable all mayors, in the selection of their
  vestures, to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the
  dearest.'"&mdash;<i>Morning Post</i>, Oct. 26. 1850.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">F. S. Q.</p>

  <p>As I was the first to open the fire on the very puzzling subject of
  the SS. Collar, which has led to more pleasant and profitable, though
  <i>warm</i> discussion, than ever any person could have expected, it
  seems now to be time for some to step forward as a moderator; and if I be
  allowed to do so, it will be to endeavour to check the almost
  <i>uncourteous</i> way in which our <span class="sc">Armiger</span>
  friend has taken up the gauntlet on the question.</p>

  <p>If, Sir, you admit <i>severe</i> and sneering criticism, it will, it
  may be feared, tend very considerably to mar the influence and advantage
  to be drawn from your useful pages, which are intended, I conceive, for
  calm, friendly and courteous interchange of useful information. Without
  vituperating the <i>lucubrations</i> of <span class="sc">Mr. John Gough
  Nichols</span>, or sneering at those who "pin faith on his dicta," which
  have much merit (Vol. ii., p. 363.), it would be surely possible for
  <span class="sc">Armiger</span> to advance his own views with good temper
  and friendly feeling.</p>

  <p>I have also a word to say to <span class="sc">Mr. Nichols</span> on
  his remarks on <span class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe's</span> view. He imputes
  to <span class="sc">Mr. E.</span> ignorance of the "real formation of the
  collar." He could only mean that the S hook or link gave <i>the idea</i>
  of such an ornamental chain; and I believe he is correct: which ornament
  the taste of the workman would adopt and fashion as we now have it, with
  the insertion of another link both for the comfort of the wearer, and for
  variety in the construction.</p>

  <p>A series of SSes (SSS) by themselves would certainly be a galling
  badge, whatever honour might be considered to be conferred with it.</p>

  <p class="author">B. (original),<br />in future SS., as my initial has been<br />usurped by some unknown friend.</p>

  <p>October. 30. 1850.</p>

  <p><i>Collar of Esses.</i>&mdash;I am glad to see the interest shown by
  your correspondents upon this curious subject, and the various opinions
  expressed by them as to the actual formation of the collar; the
  signification of the letter, if a letter be intended (of which I think
  there can be no reasonable doubt); and the persons who were privileged to
  wear it. The first two questions will for ever occasion discussion; but
  allow me to suggest that one step towards the solution of the third,
  would be a collection in your pages of the names of those persons who,
  either on their monumental effigies or brasses, or in their portraits or
  otherwise, are <!-- Page 395 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page395"></a>{395}</span>represented as wearing that ornament;
  together with a short statement of the position held by each of these
  individuals in the court of the then reigning monarch, seeming to warrant
  the assumption. Some notices of this sort have been already given, and
  your antiquarian correspondents will readily supply others; so that in a
  little time you will have obtained such a list as will greatly assist the
  inquiry. It may serve as a commencement if I refer to the atchievement of
  Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, in the reign of Richard II., a
  representation of which is given in <i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>, vol. xxix. p.
  387., where the Collar of Esses is introduced in a very peculiar
  manner.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Edward Foss.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[As we think the origin and probable meaning of the Collar of Esses
  have now been discussed as far as they can be with advantage in the
  present state of our knowledge, we propose to adopt Mr. Foss's
  suggestion, and in future to limit our columns to a record of such facts
  as he points out.]</p>

<h3>DANIEL DE FOE.</h3>

  <p>Having been much interested with Daniel Defoe's description of a
  <i>Gravesend Tiltboat</i> in the year 1724, as recorded by <span
  class="sc">Alpha</span> in Vol. ii., p. 209., I think some of your
  readers may be pleased to learn that it is quite possible that "it may be
  a plain relation of matter of fact," as De Foe was engaged in the
  business of brick and tile making near Tilbury<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, and must consequently have had
  frequent occasion to make the trip from Gravesend to London. That De Foe
  was so engaged at Tilbury we learn from the following Proclamation for
  his apprehension, taken from the <i>London Gazette</i>, dated St.
  James's, January 10, 1702-3:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><span class="sc">Whereas</span> Daniel de Foe, alias Fooe, is charged
  with writing a scandalous and seditious pamphlet, entitled <i>The
  Shortest Way with the Dissenters</i>. He is a middled siz'd spare man,
  about forty years old, of a brown complexion, and dark brown-coloured
  hair, but wears a wig; a hooked nose, a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a
  large mole near his mouth; was born in London, and, for many years an
  hose-factor in Freeman's Yard, Cornhill, and is now owner of the brick
  and pantile works near Tilbury Fort, in Essex. Whoever shall discover the
  said Daniel de Foe to one of Her Majesty's principal secretaries of
  state, or any one of Her Majesty's justices of the peace, so as he may be
  apprehended, shall have a reward of fifty pounds, which Her Majesty has
  ordered immediately to be paid on such discovery."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He soon gave himself up; and having been tried, he stood in the
  pillory with great fortitude: for soon after he published his poem,
  entitled <i>A Hymn to the Pillory</i>, in which are the following
  singular lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Men that are men, in thee can feel no pain,</p>
      <p>And all thy insignificants disdain;</p>
      <p>Contempt, that false new word for shame,</p>

      <p>But never frights the wise or well fix'd mind&mdash;</p>
      <p>Virtue despises human scorn,</p>

  <p>Referring to a design of putting the learned Selden into the pillory

      <p>He had thy lofty pinnacles in view,</p>
      <p>But so much honour never was they due.</p>
      <p>Had the great Selden triumph'd on thy stage,</p>
      <p>Selden, the honour of his age,</p>
      <p>No man would ever shun thee more,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This original poem ends with these remarkable lines, referring to
  himself:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Tell them, the men that placed him here,</p>
      <p>Are scandals to the times,</p>

      <p>And can't commit his crimes."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>De Foe, however, was afterwards received into favour without any
  concessions on his part, and proceeded straight onwards in the discharge
  of what he deemed to be his duty to mankind. He certainly was an
  extraordinary man for disinterestedness, perseverance, and industry.</p>

<h3>"ANTIQUITAS SÃCULI JUVENTUS MUNDI."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., pp. 218. 350.)</p>

  <p>T. J. and his Dublin friend (Vol. ii., p. 350.), appear to refer, one
  to the Latin version, the other to the original English text of Lord
  Bacon's <i>Instauration</i>; and, oddly enough, the inference to which
  either points, as a reason for disbelieving in the previous existence of
  the phrase "Antiquitas" &amp;c., extends not to the authority consulted
  by the other. Thus, the circumstance of "<i>ordine retrogrado</i>" being
  printed also in Italics, is true only in respect of the <i>English</i>
  text; while, on the other <!-- Page 396 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page396"></a>{396}</span>hand, "<i>ut vere dicamus</i>" is an
  expression to be found only in the <i>Latin</i>.</p>

  <p>But it may be doubted whether the originality of the phrase
  "Antiquitas sÃ¦culi juventus mundi" is, after all, worth speculating upon.
  In the sense in which Lord Bacon used it, it is rather a naked truism
  than a wise aphorism. It does not even necessarily convey the intended
  meaning; nor, if unaccompanied by an explanation, would it be safe from a
  widely different interpretation. A previous correspondent of "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" had termed it "this fine aphoristic
  expression;" and yet, when Lord Bacon himself expands the thought into an
  aphorism, he does so without recurring to the phrase in question, which
  is a tolerably fair proof that he did not look upon it as a peculiarly
  happy one. (<i>Novum Organum</i>, lib. 1., Aphorismus <span
  class="scac">LXXXIV</span>.)</p>

  <p>T. J. infers that if the phrase were a quotation it would have been
  preceded by "ut dictum est" rather than by "ut dicamus"&mdash;but even if
  it had been introduced by the first of these forms, it does not appear
  that it would thereby have been proved to be a quotation; because there
  are instances wherein Lord Bacon directly refers to the source from which
  he professes to quote, and yet prefers to give the purport in his own
  words rather than in those of his author. Thus, in citing one of the most
  exquisite and familiar passages of Lucretius, he introduces it by the
  prefix, "<i>Poeta elegantissime dixit</i>." And yet what follows,
  although printed in italics with every appearance of strict quotation, is
  not the language of Lucretius, but a commonplace prose version of its
  substance. (<i>Sermones Fideles</i>, De Veritate.)</p>

  <p>With reference to Lord Bacon's works, there are two Queries which I
  wish to ask.</p>

  <p>T. J.'s friend mentions a rare translation into English by Gilbert
  Wats, Oxford, as existing in Primate Marsh's library. Query, <i>Of
  what</i> is it a translation?</p>

  <p>In Lord Bacon's life, by William Rawley, it is stated that his
  lordship was born in a house "infra plateam dictum <i>Le Strand</i> juxta
  Londinum."</p>

  <p>Query, Was the Strand ever known as <i>Le Strand</i>, similarly to
  Adwick-<i>le-street</i> in Yorkshire?</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Sir Gammer Vans</i> (Vol. ii., pp 89. 280.).&mdash;The story
  related by S. G. is the same that I inquired after, and I admire the
  accuracy of his memory, for his version is, for the greater part,
  <i>literally</i> the same that I heard in Ireland sixty years ago. A few
  passages, as that about <i>hipper switches</i>, I do not recollect; and
  one or two that I remember are wanting&mdash;the one, that the narrator
  was received in "a little <i>oak</i> parlour" of, I forget what,
  different character; the other, that Sir Gammer's "mother," or "aunt, was
  a justice of peace, and his sister a captain of horse." I find that
  Goldsmith's allusion is to this last passage, with some variation. Tony
  Lumpkin tells Marlow that Hardcastle will endeavour to persuade him that
  "his mother was an alderman and his aunt a justice of peace." (<i>She
  Stoops to Conquer</i>, A. i. <i>sub fine</i>.) I have not been able to
  find the allusion in Swift; nor can I see how it could have been a
  <i>political</i> satire. It seems rather to be a mere tissue of
  incongruities and contradictions&mdash;of Irish bulls, in short, woven
  into a narrative to make folks laugh; and it is much of the same
  character as many other pieces of ingenious nonsense with which Swift and
  Sheridan used to amuse each other.</p>

  <p class="author">C.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Gammer Vans.</i>&mdash;This worthy is mentioned in that curious
  little chap-book, <i>A Strange and Wonderful Relation of the Old Woman
  that was drowned at Ratcliff Highway</i>, in two parts. I now quote the
  passage from a copy of the genuine Aldermary churchyard
  edition:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At last I arrived at Sir John Vang's house. 'Tis a little house
  entirely alone, encompassed about with forty or fifty houses, having a
  brick wall made of flint stone round about it. So knocking at the door,
  Gammer Vangs, said I, is Sir John Vangs within? Walk in, said she, and
  you shall see him in the little, great, round, three square parlour. This
  Gammer Vangs had a little old woman her son. Her mother was a
  churchwarden of a large troop of horse, and her grandmother was a Justice
  of the Peace; but when I came into the said great, little, square, round,
  three corner'd parlour, I could not see Sir John Vangs, for he was a
  giant. But I espied abundance of nice wicker bottles. And just as I was
  going out he called to me and asked me what I would have? So looking back
  I espied him just creeping out of a wicker bottle. It seems by his
  profession he was a wicker bottle maker. And after he had made them, he
  crept out at the stopper holes."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There are two notes worth recording with respect to this curious
  medley, which is obviously a modern version of a much older composition.
  Query, is any older edition known?</p>

  <p>1. That the wood-cut on the title page, which has been re-engraved for
  Mr. Halliwell's <i>Notices of Fugitive Tracts and Chap-books</i>, printed
  for the Percy Society, is one of the few representations we have of the
  old <i>Ducking Stool</i>.</p>

  <p>2. That it is said that the Rev. Thomas Kerrich, the well-known
  librarian of the University of Cambridge, could repeat by heart the whole
  of the eight and forty pages of this strange gallimawfrey.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. J. Thoms.</span></p>

  <p><i>Hipperswitches</i> (Vol. ii., p. 280.).&mdash;I saw a story which
  was copied into the <i>Examiner</i> of Oct. 5. from "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," entitled "Sir Gammer Vans." The
  correspondent who has furnished <!-- Page 397 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page397"></a>{397}</span>you with the tale says that he is ignorant
  of the meaning of "hipper switches." Now hipper is a word applied in this
  part of the country to a description of osiers used in coarse basket
  making, and which were very likely things to be bound up into switches. A
  field in which they grow, near the water side, is called a "hipper-holm."
  There is a station on the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway, which takes
  its name from such a meadow. My nurse, a Cornwall woman, tells me
  <i>hipper</i> withies fetch a higher price than common withies in her
  country.</p>

  <p><i>Cat and Bagpipes</i> (Vol. ii., p. 266.).&mdash;A public-house of
  considerable notoriety, with this sign, existed long at the corner of
  Downing Street, next to King Street. It was also used as a chop-house,
  and frequented by many of those connected with the public offices in the
  neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>An old friend told me that many years ago he met George Rose,&mdash;so
  well known in after life as the friend of Pitt, clerk of the Parliament,
  secretary of the Treasury, &amp;c., and executor of the Earl of
  Marchmont,&mdash;then a bashful young man, at the Cat and Bagpipes.</p>

  <p>I may mention that George Rose was one of the few instances which I
  have met with, where a Scotsman had freed himself from the peculiarities
  of the speech of his country. Sir William Grant was another. Frank Homer
  was a third. I never knew another.</p>

  <p class="author">R.</p>

  <p><i>Forlot, Firlot, or Furlet</i> (Vol. i., p. 371.).&mdash;It may be
  interesting to your correspondent J. S. to be informed that there is a
  measure of capacity in universal use in this part of India called a
  <i>fara</i> or <i>fura</i>, which is identical in shape, and, as nearly
  as can be judged by the eye, in size, with the Scottish <i>furlet</i>.
  The <i>fura</i> is divided into sixteen <i>pilys</i>, a small measure in
  universal use here; in like manner as the <i>furlet</i> is divided into
  sixteen <i>lipys</i>, which measure was, and I presume still is, in
  general use throughout Scotland. A friend informs me that, in the west of
  Scotland, the common pronunciation of the word <i>furlet</i> is exactly
  the same as that of the word <i>fura</i> here by the Mahrattas. It is
  unnecessary to point out the numerous instances in which such changes as
  that from <i>pily</i> to <i>lipy</i> take place <i>per
  metathesem</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, an interesting subject of investigation, supposing the
  coincidence above noticed not to be an accidental one, would be to trace
  the links of connexion between these words; and in this, some of your
  German readers may be enabled to afford valuable aid.</p>

  <p>As an illustration of the same article being in use in widely distant
  localities, I may mention that on returning to England from a voyage to
  China, I brought with me a Chinese <i>abacus</i> or <i>swanpan</i>, the
  instrument in general use among the Chinese for performing the ordinary
  computations of addition, subtraction, &amp;c., thinking it a grand
  article of curiosity, particularly in a remote seaport town on the east
  coast, with which to astonish the natives. But what was my chagrin when I
  was informed by an honest Baltic skipper, that to him, at least the
  instrument was no rarity at all; that he had seen them used hundreds of
  times for the same purposes at various ports in the Baltic; and that,
  moreover, he had one of them in his home at that very time, which he
  forthwith produced.</p>

  <p><i>Sitting during the Lessons</i> (Vol. ii., p. 246.).&mdash;The
  rubric directing the people to stand while the Gospel is read in the
  Communion service, was first inserted in the Scotch Common Prayer Book,
  <span class="scac">A. D.</span> 1637. The ancient and more reverential
  practice of standing whenever any portion of God's word is read, had not
  fallen into entire disuse as late as 1686, as will appear from the
  following extract from <i>The Life of Bishop Wilson</i>, by Cruttwell,
  prefixed to the folio edition of his works. It occurs (p. 4.) under
  certain heads of advice given to that holy bishop, at the time he was
  ordained deacon, by his much-esteemed friend, Archdeacon
  Hewetson:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Never to miss the church's public devotions twice a day, when
  unavoidable business, or want of health, or of a church (as in
  travelling), does not hinder. In church to behave himself also very
  reverently; nor ever turn his back upon the altar in service time, nor on
  the minister, when it can be avoided; <i>to stand at the lessons and
  epistle as well as at the gospel</i>, and especially when a psalm is
  sung: to bow reverently at the name of Jesus whenever it is mentioned in
  any of the church's offices; to turn towards the east when the Gloria
  Patri and the creeds are rehearsing; and to make obeisance at coming
  into, and going out of the church, and at going up to, and coming down
  from, the altar; are all ancient, commendable, and devout usages, and
  which <i>thousands</i> of good people of our Church practise at this day,
  and amongst them, if he deserves to be reckoned amongst them, Thomas
  Wilson's dear friend."</p>

  <p><i>News</i> (Vol. ii., p. 81.).&mdash;Much wit and ingenuity have been
  wasted on this word. It seems <!-- Page 398 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page398"></a>{398}</span>clear, however, that its origin is Dutch
  or German, and probably Flemish, like the "<span class="scac">NEW'S
  BOOK</span>," so frequently occurring in the correspondence of the
  seventeenth century.</p>

  <p>Look into that valuable German, French, and Latin dictionary of the
  Elzeviers, Amst. 1664, where you will find "<span class="sc">Newe</span>,
  <i>F.</i> une novelle; <i>Lat.</i> nova, novorum." Then follow "Etwas
  newes, quelque chose de nouveau; Aliquid novi;" and "Was newes, quelles
  nouvelles;" or, more accurately, "Quid novi; quoi de nouveau?" The
  inference is forced upon us that, during the Flemish wars, in which the
  Sidneys and a long catalogue of noble English volunteers distinguished
  themselves, the thing and the term were imported hither.</p>

  <p>Agreeably to so natural a presumption, the Hollandish "Nieuws" occurs,
  as a neuter substantive, in the sense of "niewe tijding," or "nouvelles,"
  and, of course, the English "news," as perfect as can be wished. It is
  true that the "Nieuws-Boek" now circulates under the modest name of
  "Nieuws-Papieren," or of "Nieuws-Verteller:" but, to convince readers
  wise enough not to expect in such matters as these a geometrical
  demonstration, what is here humbly stated might suffice.</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of Orchard.</i>&mdash;What is the derivation of

  hay-yard?</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Were <i>Anschar, a Story of the North</i>, a mere work of fiction, we
  should not think of recording its appearance in our columns. But it has
  other claims to our notice and the attention of our readers. Based on the
  life of Anschar the monk of Corbey, by Rembert, his successor in the
  archiepiscopal see of Hamburgh,&mdash;a biography which the writer of the
  work before us describes as one of the most important documents we
  possess for the elucidation of the early history, manners, and religion
  of the races of Northern Europe,&mdash;Mr. King has produced a narrative
  of considerable interest, abounding in curious pictures of the social
  condition of the Swedish people at the close of the ninth century. But
  Mr. King's pleasing story has also this additional merit, that while his
  learning and scholarlike acquirements have enabled him to illustrate the
  early history, religion, customs, and superstitions of the North in a
  most interesting and instructive manner, he has so done this, as at the
  same time to throw much curious light on many of our own old-world
  customs, popular observances, and folk-lore.</p>

  <p>Such of our clerical readers as may be anxious to introduce cheap maps
  into the schools under their superintendence, will thank us for calling
  their attention to the series of <i>Penny Maps</i> (twopence each with
  the boundaries coloured), now publishing by Messrs. Chapman and Hall.
  That they have been constructed and engraved by Mr. J. W. Lowry, is a
  sufficient guarantee for their accuracy.</p>

  <p>We have received a copy of Mr. Walker's engraving from Mr. Doyle's
  picture of <i>Caxton submitting his proof-sheet to John Esteney, Abbot of
  Westminster, in 1477</i>. The subject&mdash;and what can be of greater
  interest to us than the great event it commemorates, the vast social
  change it has wrought&mdash;has been very ably treated by the artist, and
  very successfully rendered by the engraver. The calm dignity of the
  patriotic mercer, Master William Caxton, as he watches the countenance of
  the abbot, who is examining with astonishment this first specimen of the
  new art, contrasts well with the expression of pride exhibited by Earl
  Rivers at the success of his protÃ©gÃ©, on whose shoulder he rests his hand
  with an air half-patronizing, half-familiar, and with Wynkyn de Worde at
  the case behind, constitute altogether a picture which tells its story
  well and effectually, and furnishes a Caxton Memorial which will
  doubtless be very acceptable to all those who remember, with the
  gratitude due to him, the many precious volumes with which the learning
  of Caxton, no less than his mechanical genius, enriched the literature of
  England.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson will sell on Monday next, and the two
  following days, an interesting Collection of engraved British Portraits,
  the property of the late Mr. Dodd, the author of the <i>Connoisseur's
  Repertorium</i>. We may specify one lot as very interesting to lovers of
  illustrated works, viz. a copy of Robert Smythe's <i>History of the

  illustrative of the printed text.</p>

  <p><i>As we again propose this week to circulate a large number of copies
  of</i> "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," <i>among members of
  the different provincial Literary Institutions, we venture, for the
  purpose of furthering the objects for which our paper was instituted, to
  repeat the following passage from our 52nd Number:&mdash;</i></p>

  <p>It is obvious that the use of a paper like "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>" bears a direct proportion to the extent of its
  circulation. What it aims at doing is, to reach the learning which lies
  scattered not only throughout every part of our own country, but all over
  the literary world, and to bring it all to bear upon the pursuits of the
  scholar; to enable, in short, men of letters all over the world to give a
  helping hand to one another. To a certain extent, we have accomplished
  this end. Our last number contains communications not only from all parts
  of the metropolis, and from almost every county in England, but also from
  Scotland, Ireland, Holland, and even from Demerara. This looks well. It
  seems as if we were in a fair way to accomplish our design. But much yet
  remains to be done. We have recently been told of whole districts in
  England so benighted as never to have heard of "<span class="sc">Notes
  and Queries</span>;" and after an interesting question has been discussed
  for weeks in our columns, we are informed of some one who could have
  answered it immediately if he had seen it. So long as this is the case
  the advantage we may confer upon literature and literary men is
  necessarily imperfect. We do what we can to make known our existence
  through the customary modes of announcement, and we gratefully
  acknowledge the kind assistance and encouragement we derive from our
  brethren of the public press; but we would respectfully solicit the
  assistance of our friends upon this particular point. Our purpose is
  aided, and our usefulness increased by every introduction which can be
  given to our paper, either to a Book Club, to a Lending Library, or to
  any other channel of circulation amongst persons of inquiry and
  intelligence. By such introductions scholars help themselves as well as
  us, for there is no inquirer throughout the kingdom who is not
  occasionally able to throw light upon some of the multifarious objects
  which are discussed in our pages.</p>
